## Sprint 5 – T13 GUI functional wiring

**Date**: $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Created comprehensive failing tests in `tests/test_gui_functional.py` following TDD principles (10 tests)
- [x] Implemented `app/gui/manual_tab.py` with complete backend integration:
  - File selection dialog with CSV/XLSX support
  - Background worker thread (`ManualSyncWorker`) for non-blocking operations
  - Complete workflow: parse → push to Sheets → compute diff → Slack notify
  - Live status updates with diff counts format "+added / updated / deleted"
  - Clickable Sheet URL links with `setOpenExternalLinks(True)`
  - Professional UI with sections for file selection and sync status
- [x] Implemented `app/gui/watcher_tab.py` with complete watcher functionality:
  - Folder selection with browse dialog and manual path input
  - Start/Stop watch controls with visual state indicators
  - Background worker thread (`WatcherWorker`) managing Watcher instance
  - Live diff updates and Slack status with emoji indicators (✅/❌)
  - Thread-safe signal/slot communication between worker and UI
  - Automatic folder creation if watch directory doesn't exist
- [x] Added `app/gui/resources.py` for icons and visual elements:
  - Emoji-based icon system with checkmark, cross, warning, info icons
  - Status icon mapping for success/error/warning states
  - QIcon creation utilities for future native icon support
- [x] Ensured all quality gates pass: ruff clean, black formatted, 100% test pass rate
- [x] Thread-safety: All backend operations run in worker threads with Qt signal communication
- [x] Updated `docs/status.md` with Sprint 5 – T13 completion

### GUI Functional Integration Features:
- **ManualSyncTab**: Complete file-to-Sheets workflow with live status updates
  - "Select File" button → QFileDialog → parse → SheetsClient.push_dataframe → DeltaTracker.compute_diff → SlackNotifier.post_summary
  - Status displays: diff counts "+3 / 0 / 0" format and clickable Sheet URLs
  - Background processing prevents GUI freezing during operations
  - Error handling with user-friendly dialogs and logging
- **WatcherTab**: Real-time file monitoring with complete backend integration

### Technical Implementation:
```python
# ManualSyncTab usage - integrated workflow:
# 1. User clicks "Select File" → QFileDialog opens
# 2. File selected → ManualSyncWorker thread starts
# 3. Worker: parse_file() → SheetsClient.push_dataframe() → DeltaTracker.compute_diff() → SlackNotifier.post_summary()
# 4. Signals update GUI: diff_status_label shows "+3 / 0 / 0", url_status_label shows clickable link

# WatcherTab usage - real-time monitoring:
# 1. User sets folder path and clicks "Start Watch"
# 2. WatcherWorker starts Watcher instance in background thread
# 3. File detected → same workflow as manual sync
# 4. Live updates: watcher_diff_label and slack_status_label update in real-time
```
